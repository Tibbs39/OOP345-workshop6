This workshop has refreshed me on how to work with polymorphic classes,
and handling errors using try/catch method. I have also learned the basics 
of how to utilize an STL vector. While the STL container class may be more 
convienent, I wonder if it could possibly be more efficent to implement 
your own container class if it can better fit the needs of your design.
